* counsel-org-capture-string [[https://melpa.org/#/counsel-org-capture-string][file:https://melpa.org/packages/counsel-org-capture-string-badge.svg]] [[https://travis-ci.org/akirak/counsel-org-capture-string.svg?branch=master]]

This is a counsel wrapper for =org-capture-string= in Emacs Org mode. 

=org-capture-string= is a function that lets you fire an =org-capture= template with a given initial input. Unlike the normal =org-capture= with which you have to choose a template before you type input, =org-capture-string= lets you enter input text before you choose a template. I personally find this workflow often more "natural", because I usually seem to come up with an idea before thinking about where to refile it.

=counsel-org-capture-string= is like =org-capture-string=, but it lets you enter input via [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][Ivy]]. Because it is based on Ivy, it supports alternative actions such as insertion and copying. =counsel-org-capture-string= also supports defining functions for generating completion candidates so that you can enter a particular keyword efficiently. That is, =counsel-org-capture-string= is an omni note-taking interface for Emacs.

** Prerequisites
This package requires Emacs 25.1.
** Installation
This package is available from MELPA as =counsel-org-capture-string=.
** Configuration
You don't need an initial configuration to use this package, but it allows you to set options via the Emacs customization interface. Check out =counsel-org-capture-string= group. In particular, =counsel-org-capture-string-sources= allows you to customize candidates
** Usage
Run =counsel-org-capture-string= command. Its basic usage is the same as =org-capture-string=.

1. Enter input.
2. Choose an =org-capture= template.
*** Guide to Ivy
Because the command is based on Ivy, any knowledge about Ivy applies to it. The following tips may be useful when you use this package:

- ~M-i~ to insert the candidate into the mini buffer and continue editing
- ~M-n~ to enter a symbol at point
- ~M-y~ to insert text from the kill ring
- ~M-o~ to select an alternative action
  - ~i~ to insert the candidate into the original buffer
  - ~w~ to store the candidate to the kill ring
  - =ivy-add-actions= lets you define extra actions
- ~C-r~ to review the history
